**Before a Flood:**
- Know your area's flood evacuation routes.
- Prepare an emergency kit with food, water, flashlight, batteries, and first-aid.
- Keep important documents in waterproof containers.
- Monitor weather alerts and warnings from reliable sources.

**During a Flood:**
- Evacuate immediately if advised by authorities.
- Move to higher ground and stay away from rivers, streams, and drains.
- Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters. Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down.
- Keep updated via local radio, TV, or mobile apps.
- Disconnect electrical appliances to prevent shock.

**If Trapped:**
- Move to the highest level of your home. Only go to the roof if necessary.
- Call emergency services and signal for help.

**After a Flood:**
- Return home only when authorities declare it safe.
- Avoid contact with floodwater ‚Äì it may be contaminated.
- Disinfect all surfaces and items that came into contact with floodwaters.
- Beware of mold and structural damage in buildings.
